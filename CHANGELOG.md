# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.7] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- `folder_cleaner history`, `show-plan`, and `doctor` actions for saved plan/run inspection, run-health diagnostics, and repairable restore workflows.

### Changed

- Upgraded `folder_cleaner` planning and execution with aggressive quarantine-only cleanup defaults, preflight validation, incremental run manifests, richer previews, modern image-format rules, and safer destination-folder handling.
- Improved `folder_cleaner clean` approval for large plans with a compact action-mode selector instead of echoing every selected action into the terminal prompt.

### Fixed

- Existing `folder_cleaner` configs now merge newly supported default rules, so modern image formats such as AVIF, TIFF, and raw camera files are organized without recreating the config.
- `folder_cleaner restore` and `apply` now provide helpful recovery when a plan id, or a run-like id made from a plan timestamp, is passed to the wrong command.
- Box and table UI rendering now keeps borders aligned without recoloring or stretching cell content.


## [0.5.6] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Folder Cleaner Plugin** (`folder_cleaner`): find and clean common generated folders from projects.
- **Color output mode**: control when lla emits colored output.
- `sizemap` total summary output for a quick aggregate size overview.

### Changed

- Refined plugin management and installer output with boxed sections, aligned plugin/version rows, clearer update/install summaries, and terminal-width-aware truncation.

### Fixed

- Formatter plugin loading now reports safe errors instead of unwrapping failures.


## [0.5.5] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed

- Avoid recursive directory size calculation in non-size views, improving performance for large parent directories when `include_dirs = true` while preserving recursive sizing for size-aware outputs and filters. Thanks to @Maanas-Verma for the fix in [#154](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/pull/154).

### Changed

- Reworked releases into a shorter prepare-and-merge flow:
  - `Prepare Release` now opens a conventional release-prep PR that bumps workspace, internal dependency, plugin, lockfile, and changelog versions.
  - Merging the release-prep PR now creates the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag automatically and runs the release pipeline.
  - Release publishing now builds and verifies all binaries, plugin archives, OS packages, themes, and checksums before publishing crates.io packages and the GitHub release.
  - Changelog entries can now be written under `## [Unreleased]`; the prepare workflow promotes that section to the target version and leaves a fresh `## [Unreleased]` section.


## [0.5.4] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

- `--no-dotfiles` precedence between CLI flag and config: previously, the CLI flag alone was not enough to hide dotfiles because the logic required `config.filter.no_dotfiles` to also be `true`. Now either the CLI flag (`--no-dotfiles`) or the config setting (`filter.no_dotfiles = true`) will hide dotfiles, unless `--all` or `--almost-all` is passed.

Thanks to @eihqnh for the fix.

## [0.5.3] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- `lla --fuzzy` editor integration now properly handles empty editor config strings, allowing the fallback chain to work correctly when the config editor field is empty.

Thanks to @chenrui333 for the pr #148

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- `lla --fuzzy`:

  - Vim/Emacs-style navigation shortcuts: `Ctrl+J/K`, `Ctrl+N/P`, `Ctrl+U/D` (half-page), `Ctrl+G` (jump to end), `Ctrl+Shift+G` (jump to start).
  - Search bar editing shortcuts: `Ctrl+W` (delete word backward), `Ctrl+H` (delete character), `Ctrl+A` (start of line), `Home`/`End`.
  - Inline rename: `F2` to rename the selected file, `Enter` to confirm, `Esc`/`Ctrl+C` to cancel.
  - External editor integration: `Ctrl+E` opens the selected (or multi-selected) file(s) in your editor.
    - Editor precedence: `listers.fuzzy.editor` (config) → `$EDITOR` → `$VISUAL` → fallback.

- **Homebrew Plugin** (`brew`): manage Homebrew packages from lla (list/search/info/install/uninstall/upgrade/cleanup/doctor) with an interactive menu.
- **Hacker News Plugin** (`hackernews`): browse Top/Best/New/Ask/Show/Jobs, open articles/comments, copy URLs, and use an interactive browser with caching.
- **Remove Paywall Plugin** (`remove_paywall`): generate paywall-bypass links (12ft/archive.is/RemovePaywall/Freedium/Google Cache), with clipboard support, history, and preferences.
- **Speed Test Plugin** (`speed_test`): test latency + download speed, keep history, and offer an interactive menu.

### Changed

- `lla plugin <name>` now works without an explicit action: in TTY it prefers a plugin `menu` action when available, otherwise falls back to `help` (non-interactive defaults to `help`).
- Startup error handling now prints a clean, categorized error block and exits with a non-zero status instead of panicking on some parse failures.
- Plugin errors now provide more guidance:
  - Missing plugin names now include a list of available plugins (or a hint to run `lla install`).
  - Unknown plugin actions try to include the plugin’s available actions list (when discoverable).

### Fixed

- `lla diff` now reports missing required arguments with a clear usage/help message (instead of panicking).
- `speed_test` latency checks now use reliable HTTPS endpoints, downloads respect `test_size_mb`, and responses are streamed to avoid buffering large payloads in memory.
- `remove_paywall` now properly URL-encodes `archive.is` (and Google Cache) links when embedding an original URL into query parameters.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- **Interactive Init Wizard** (`lla init`, use `--default` to skip) that walks through icon, theme, default view, and Git-focused setup choices before writing a tailored config.
- **Per-directory profiles** via `.lla.toml`. lla now searches upward from the current working directory and overlays the nearest profile on top of the global config for safe, opt-in repo defaults.
- **Config introspection commands**:
  - `lla config show-effective` prints the merged configuration (global + profile) so you can see what actually applies in the current directory.
  - `lla config diff --default` highlights every overridden key, the default value, the effective value, and whether the change came from the global config or the profile file.
- **Theme preview** (`lla theme preview <name>`) renders a sample directory listing plus a ripgrep-style match preview so you can compare color palettes without swapping themes.
- **Range filter syntax** for size/modified/created metadata (`--size`, `--modified`, `--created`) with human-friendly comparisons like `>10M`, `2024-01-01..`.
- **Named filter presets** via `[filter.presets.<name>]` blocks in the config, reusable through `--preset`.
- **Result refinement** (`--refine`) that reuses cached listings so you can iteratively filter without re-scanning the filesystem.
- **Search pipelines** (`--search-pipe plugin:action[:arg...]`) to feed ripgrep matches directly into plugins such as `file_tagger:list-tags` or `file_organizer:organize:type`.
- **Diff command** (`lla diff`) can now compare directories _and_ individual files (local↔local or against git references), showing per-entry size deltas for directories plus size/line summaries and unified diffs for files.
- **Column customization for long/table views** via `[formatters.long].columns` and `[formatters.table].columns`, including plugin-provided fields through `field:<name>` entries.
- **Optional .gitignore filtering** for every listing format via `--respect-gitignore`, `--no-gitignore`, and a new `filter.respect_gitignore` config key (fuzzy view included).
- **CLI upgrade command** (`lla upgrade`) that reuses the install script pipeline to download the latest release (or a specified tag), verify `SHA256SUMS`, render progress indicators, and atomically replace the local binary.

### Changed

- `lla init` now uses a multi-section guided flow with themed step banners, expanded prompts (sort order, directory inclusion, depth limits, sorting/filtering toggles, long-view columns, plugin directory + recursion guards), and a richer summary. Run `lla init --default` to write the stock config without launching the wizard.
- `lla config` now renders a structured, colorized summary instead of dumping the raw struct, making it easy to review key defaults (view/sort/filter, formatter tweaks, plugin status, limits) at a glance.
- Plugin installation/update workflows now show animated banners plus per-plugin progress bars/spinners, along with success/error callouts so you can follow downloads, builds, and updates in real time.
- Git-backed diffs now treat the reference as the baseline so additions/removals are reported from the working tree's perspective, and file diffs validate references, detect binary content, and emit clearer error messages.
- Installation script (`install.sh`) now features polished visual styling matching the CLI upgrade command, with animated spinners, structured sections, consistent color theming, and improved error handling.

### Fixed

- `lla --fuzzy` no longer captures plain `y`/`o` keystrokes while you type; the copy and open shortcuts now require `Ctrl+Y`/`Ctrl+O`, so search queries can include those characters without triggering actions. ([#142](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/issues/142))

### Docs

- Documented the wizard, `.lla.toml` profiles, new config commands, and theme preview usage in the README.
- Added README coverage for range filters, presets, cache-based refinement, and search→plugin pipelines.
- Documented the diff command’s directory and file workflows (including git examples) plus column customization examples in the README.

- Plugin installation flow features themed progress spinners and richer status messaging for a cleaner, modern experience.

### Docs

- Documented the new prebuilt plugin installation flow and updated default instructions.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-09-16

### Added

  - Interactive directory jumper with keyboard-driven prompt using arrow keys/Enter
  - **One-command setup**: `lla jump --setup` automatically configures shell integration
  - Auto-detects shell (bash, zsh, fish) and adds `j` function for seamless directory changing
  - Add directories to bookmarks with `lla jump --add <PATH>`
  - Remove bookmarks with `lla jump --remove <PATH>`
  - List all bookmarks and recent history with `lla jump --list`
  - Clear directory history with `lla jump --clear-history`

  - Bookmarks are prioritized in the interactive prompt
  - Integration with existing `exclude_paths` configuration
  - Prevents duplicate shell function installation

- Ripgrep-backed content search via `--search` flag:
- Fuzzy finder enhancements (`--fuzzy`):

  - Batch actions:
    - `Enter`: confirm selection (single or multi)
    - `y`: copy selected path(s) to clipboard (pbcopy/xclip/xsel/clip)
    - `o`: open selected path(s) with system opener (open/xdg-open/start)
  - Status bar now shows key hints for selection and actions

  - Search file contents for patterns using `lla --search "TODO"`

- Document new `--search` and `--search-context` flags in command reference

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- Stable machine-readable outputs with streaming:
  - `--json`: Outputs a single JSON array (streamed). Supports `--pretty` for human-friendly indentation.
  - `--ndjson`: Newline-delimited JSON, one object per line.
  - `--csv`: CSV with a header row. Proper escaping and UTF-8 handling via the `csv` crate.
  - Flags are mutually exclusive; `--pretty` only affects `--json`.
- Stable schema across machine modes with these fields (always present; nulls where appropriate):
  - `path`, `name`, `extension`, `file_type`, `size_bytes`, `modified`, `created`, `accessed`, `mode_octal`, `owner_user`, `owner_group`, `inode`, `hard_links`, `symlink_target`, `is_hidden`, `git_status`, and `plugin` container for plugin enrichments.
- Streaming output writers to avoid unbounded memory growth on large listings.
- Optional Git status integration into machine outputs when `-G` is used (no extra git work otherwise).
- Archive introspection (no extraction to disk):
  - Automatic detection for `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz` when a single archive file is passed as the path
  - Lists archive contents as a virtual directory and integrates with existing views: default, long, table, grid, tree, recursive
  - Works with filters, sorting, depth control, and machine outputs (`--json`, `--ndjson`, `--csv`)
  - Symlink targets in tar archives are exposed as `custom_fields["symlink_target"]`
- Single-file listing:
  - Passing a regular file path now lists that single file (instead of erroring with Not a directory)
  - All formatters and machine outputs apply normally
- Long format quality-of-life flags:
  - `--hide-group`: Hide the group column (great for single-user systems). Also configurable via `formatters.long.hide_group` in the config file.
  - `--relative-dates`: Show relative modified times (e.g., "2h ago"). Also configurable via `formatters.long.relative_dates`.
  - Relative dates are powered by `chrono-humanize` for accurate human-friendly phrasing.

### Changed

- CLI: Added mutually exclusive flags group for machine output (`--json`, `--ndjson`, `--csv`) and `--pretty`.
- Internal: Introduced `OutputMode` in CLI args to route to human vs machine formatters.
- Internal: Added a serializable adapter to normalize timestamps to ISO-8601 UTC and permissions to octal.
- Docs: Updated README with a new "Machine Output" section including schema and examples.
- Long format date column alignment is now consistent even when using relative dates.
- Grid formatter no longer appends an extra trailing blank newline; output ends without an extra empty line.

### Fixed

- Non-fatal metadata read failures are handled gracefully during machine output; entries still emit with nulls where needed and a warning on stderr, without corrupting stdout.
- Graceful handling when the provided path is a single file or an archive: no erroneous directory reads
- Relative date phrasing now correctly uses "X ago" for past times and "in X" for future times.

## [0.3.11] - 2025-01-09

### Added

- New command-line arguments for controlling file visibility:
