## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- Stable machine-readable outputs with streaming:
  - `--json`: Outputs a single JSON array (streamed). Supports `--pretty` for human-friendly indentation.
  - `--ndjson`: Newline-delimited JSON, one object per line.
  - `--csv`: CSV with a header row. Proper escaping and UTF-8 handling via the `csv` crate.
  - Flags are mutually exclusive; `--pretty` only affects `--json`.
- Stable schema across machine modes with these fields (always present; nulls where appropriate):
  - `path`, `name`, `extension`, `file_type`, `size_bytes`, `modified`, `created`, `accessed`, `mode_octal`, `owner_user`, `owner_group`, `inode`, `hard_links`, `symlink_target`, `is_hidden`, `git_status`, and `plugin` container for plugin enrichments.
- Streaming output writers to avoid unbounded memory growth on large listings.
- Optional Git status integration into machine outputs when `-G` is used (no extra git work otherwise).
- Archive introspection (no extraction to disk):
  - Automatic detection for `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz` when a single archive file is passed as the path
  - Lists archive contents as a virtual directory and integrates with existing views: default, long, table, grid, tree, recursive
  - Works with filters, sorting, depth control, and machine outputs (`--json`, `--ndjson`, `--csv`)
  - Symlink targets in tar archives are exposed as `custom_fields["symlink_target"]`
- Single-file listing:
  - Passing a regular file path now lists that single file (instead of erroring with Not a directory)
  - All formatters and machine outputs apply normally
- Long format quality-of-life flags:
  - `--hide-group`: Hide the group column (great for single-user systems). Also configurable via `formatters.long.hide_group` in the config file.
  - `--relative-dates`: Show relative modified times (e.g., "2h ago"). Also configurable via `formatters.long.relative_dates`.
  - Relative dates are powered by `chrono-humanize` for accurate human-friendly phrasing.

### Changed

- CLI: Added mutually exclusive flags group for machine output (`--json`, `--ndjson`, `--csv`) and `--pretty`.
- Internal: Introduced `OutputMode` in CLI args to route to human vs machine formatters.
- Internal: Added a serializable adapter to normalize timestamps to ISO-8601 UTC and permissions to octal.
- Docs: Updated README with a new "Machine Output" section including schema and examples.
- Long format date column alignment is now consistent even when using relative dates.
- Grid formatter no longer appends an extra trailing blank newline; output ends without an extra empty line.

### Fixed

- Non-fatal metadata read failures are handled gracefully during machine output; entries still emit with nulls where needed and a warning on stderr, without corrupting stdout.
- Graceful handling when the provided path is a single file or an archive: no erroneous directory reads
- Relative date phrasing now correctly uses "X ago" for past times and "in X" for future times.
